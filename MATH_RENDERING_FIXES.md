# Math Rendering Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Text Spacing in Math Questions
**Problem**: Questions with math expressions were being rendered without proper spacing between words.

**Solution**:
- Created a new `renderMixedTextWithMath` function that properly separates text from math expressions
- Added pattern recognition for common question formats (e.g., "What is the value of...")
- Implemented proper handling of spaces between words and math expressions

### 2. Line Breaks in Math Formulas
**Problem**: Math expressions were being split across multiple lines inappropriately.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced the rendering logic to keep math expressions together
- Improved pattern matching for mathematical expressions
- Added special handling for combined expressions like "sin x³·cos x²"

### 3. Derivative Notation
**Problem**: The "d/dx" notation wasn't rendering correctly as a proper fraction.

**Solution**:
- Added specific pattern matching for various derivative formats
- Implemented special case handling for complex derivatives like "d/dx(sin x³·cos x²)"
- Used proper LaTeX notation with `\frac{d}{dx}` for better rendering

### 4. Superscript Handling
**Problem**: Superscripts in expressions like x² and x³ were not rendering correctly.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced superscript detection and conversion
- Added specific handling for superscripts in trigonometric functions
- Improved rendering of combined expressions with multiple superscripts

### 5. Mixed Content Rendering
**Problem**: Questions mixing text and math weren't distinguishing between the two properly.

**Solution**:
- Implemented a smarter content parser that identifies math segments within text
- Created a rendering system that handles text and math separately
- Added pattern matching for common question types to apply the right formatting

## Technical Implementation

1. **Enhanced Pattern Recognition**:
   - Added regex patterns to identify common question formats
   - Implemented detection for mathematical expressions within sentences
   - Created special case handling for complex mathematical notations

2. **Improved Text Spacing**:
   - Proper preservation of spaces between text and math elements
   - Correct handling of punctuation around math expressions
   - Ensured readability of questions with embedded formulas

3. **Specialized Math Rendering**:
   - Better processing of trigonometric functions with superscripts
   - Proper rendering of derivative notation as fractions
   - Enhanced handling of special mathematical symbols and operators

## Results

The math rendering system now:
1. Correctly preserves spaces between words in questions
2. Properly renders mathematical expressions without unwanted line breaks
3. Displays complex notations like derivatives in a clear, readable format
4. Handles mixed text and math content appropriately
5. Provides correct rendering for expressions like "What is the value of d/dx(sin x³·cos x²)?"

These improvements significantly enhance the readability and clarity of math questions in the exam system, ensuring students can properly understand what's being asked.

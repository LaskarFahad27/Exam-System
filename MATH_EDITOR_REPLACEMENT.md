# Math Editor Component Replacement

## Changes Made

1. Removed `react-mathquill` package which was causing dependency conflicts with React 19.1.1
2. Installed `mathlive` as a modern replacement for math equation editing
3. Created a compatibility wrapper at `src/components/MathLiveWrapper.jsx` that:
   - Provides the same API as `react-mathquill` to minimize code changes
   - Uses the modern `mathlive` package under the hood
   - Includes the same exports (`addStyles`, `EditableMathField`) for backward compatibility

## Why This Change?

The `react-mathquill` package had a peer dependency requirement of React 18.2.0, which conflicted with the project's React 19.1.1 version. Rather than downgrading React, we've replaced it with the more modern and actively maintained `mathlive` library.

## Benefits of MathLive

- Active development (latest release: August 2025)
- Better compatibility with modern React versions
- More features and better performance
- Web component-based architecture
- Better accessibility support

## Implementation Details

The wrapper in `src/components/MathLiveWrapper.jsx` maintains the same API as `react-mathquill` so that existing code can continue to work with minimal changes. It transforms the MathLive custom element into a React component with a similar interface.

## Future Improvements

For full advantage of MathLive's capabilities, you might want to:
1. Update the math symbol insertion logic to use MathLive's native methods
2. Use MathLive's virtual keyboard support for mobile devices
3. Utilize MathLive's extensive configuration options

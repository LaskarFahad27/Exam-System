# Exam Link Access Implementation

This document explains how the exam link generation and access feature works in the Exam System.

## Overview

The system now allows admins to generate shareable exam links. These links can be sent to students, and when accessed, they will:

1. For public exams: Show exam details and allow enrollment after login
2. For private exams: Verify enrollment status after login before granting access
3. Redirect to the login screen if the user is not authenticated

## Implementation Details

### 1. API Endpoints

The system uses the following API endpoints to manage exam links:

- `/exam-links/generate/:examId` - Generate a shareable link for an exam
- `/exam-links/public/:examId/verify-access` - Verify public access to an exam
- `/exam-links/:examId/verify-access` - Verify authenticated user access to an exam
- `/user-exams/:examId/start` - Start an exam for a student

### 2. Components

#### ExamAccess.jsx

- Handles incoming requests to `/exams/:examId`
- Checks exam visibility (public vs. private)
- Verifies user access permissions
- Redirects to login if necessary
- Shows exam information for public exams
- Starts the exam for authenticated and enrolled users

#### OnlineExam.jsx

- Updated to support accessing exams by URL parameter
- Initializes exam from URL if examId is provided
- Handles exam start flow from direct links

### 3. Flow

1. Admin generates a link from Admin Panel
2. Student receives and clicks the link (`/exams/:examId`)
3. System checks if the exam is public:
   - If public, shows exam details (even to unauthenticated users)
   - If private, requires authentication
4. After login, system checks enrollment status:
   - If enrolled or public exam, redirects to start exam
   - If not enrolled, shows enrollment option
   - If no access allowed, shows access denied

### 4. Login Redirect

When a user tries to access an exam link without being logged in:

1. System stores the exam ID in `localStorage`
2. User is redirected to login page
3. After successful login, user is automatically redirected back to the exam

## Testing the Feature

1. Generate an exam link from the Admin Panel
2. Test accessing the link while logged out
3. Test accessing the link while logged in
4. Verify that proper access control is enforced based on exam visibility

## Security Considerations

- All exam access is verified on the server side
- Private exams require authentication
- Enrollment is checked before starting exams
- User tokens must be valid to access protected exams
